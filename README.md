# practice-labtest-1
Write a C++ program that inputs how much a person gave the cashier followed by the cost of the item purchased. 
Output the amount of money they are owed. All numbers are floating point. 

For example if the input is 
```
100.00  49.99
```
the output should be 
```
Customer paid 100.00 for an item costing 49.99. They are owed 50.01
```
Don't worry about how the floating point results come out. Currency format is not requested.
